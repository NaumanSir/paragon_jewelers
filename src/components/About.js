                <p>The story of Paragon Jewelers begins over three decades ago. Raj and Sheila had just met. Raj was working as an apprentice for a goldsmith and happened upon Sheila at the nearby apartment complex. The two made faces at each other through the windows and eventually became friends who eventually became even closer. Raj secretly started working on making a ring and one day proposed to Sheila, an English professor. The word "Paragon" was taken from one of Sheila's seminal works on Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet and worked into Raj's newfound jewelry store.</p>
